<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Software Engineering Group (SEG)](https://seg.nju.edu.cn/), [Computer Science and Technology Department of Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Xuandong Li and Lei Bu. My research involves the formal verification and analysis of cyber physical systems.

## Research Interest:

- **Ion-material Simulation:** SRIM, iradina, SDTrimSP, IMSIL, CORETO, TRIDYN, MARLOWE, RustBCA
- **Machine Learning:** fairness AI, penalization and augmentation methods
- **E-field controlled magnetization** VCMA, Strain-mediated ME (Magnetoelectric) Effects, Straintronic, iontronic, E-filed induced spin reorientation, SOT.
- **Micro-, Nanofabrication**
- **Neuromorphic Computing** Neuromorphic Sensing and Perception, Hybrid Computing Systems, Brain-Inspired Robotics
